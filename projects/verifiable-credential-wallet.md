# Project Name
Verifiable Credential Wallet

# Preferred Maturity Level
Labs stage

# Project Description
The Verifiable Credential Wallet is a cross-platform iOS and Android mobile application for storing and sharing digital credentials, starting with higher learning.

The wallet is based on the learner credential wallet specification developed by the Digital Credentials Consortium. 

The app works with iOS and Android and allows users to add and share credentials, as well as manage the wallet.

Whenver possible, we use existing open standards from W3C, IETF, and other open standards groups.


# Alignment with the OpenWallet Foundation Mission
This project aligns with the OWF mission, because it's an open source example implementation of wallet-related open standards.

The Digital Credentials Consortium (DCC) is a group of international postsecondary institutions leading the development of software and services that promote the adoption of W3C Verifiable Credentials in higher education. With the support of the US Department of Education, the DCC developed the open source Learner Credential Wallet (LCW), a mobile application that provides a secure, portable location for receiving, storing and sharing Verifiable Credentials.
